## Software Designing and Engineering: Encryption Project
![Encryption 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79820705/173484378-a50b7c79-9ab8-47dc-8a5b-8f79046e8d3e.png)

The artifact I chose to enhance is an encryption program from a Secure Coding course I took, and it was created in April of 2021. It is written in C++. The original program takes an input text file (with some pre-generated text), loads it into a string, and then performs a XOR encryption on it. The program then saves the string into a file called encrypteddatafile.txt. It then does the same thing to decrypt the text, saving the decrypted text into decrypteddatafile.txt. '
	
I chose this artifact because it demonstrates several basic C++ competencies, such as reading from a file, using loops, use of ints and strings, saving data to a file, printing to the terminal, etc. It also demonstrates interest in and understanding of encryption and security, which is important for anyone who wants to get into cybersecurity in the future. I improved this artifact by implementing a menu that allows the user to choose whether to use the already-implemented XOR cipher algorithm, or the newly implemented Caesar Cipher algorithm. This expands the complexity of the artifact in an interesting way, and there is room to add even more encryption algorithms as the code was written in a modular fashion. With the added encryption algorithm and interactivity from the user, I have met the course objectives I planned to meet. The enhanced artifact uses algorithmic principles (in the encryption algorithms) to solve a given problem (namely encrypting strings that would otherwise be plaintext and easier to attack). The code also demonstrates the ability to use well-founded and innovating techniques to implementing computer solutions. The use of encryption algorithms demonstrates a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture. Due to this, the enhanced artifact meets objectives CS-499-03, 04, and 05. 
	
When enhancing the artifact, one challenge for me was getting the Caesar Cipher to work. The famous Caesar Cipher is something that is easy to conceptualize and do on paper, but is much harder to do with C++. For example, using a key of four is easy to do in your head because we all know the alphabet by heart and can shift the letters easily. However, the algorithm to do that needs to be explicitly stated in the code, and there is no easy shortcut to perform that kind of shift due to the way letters are represented in the code. The solution I ended up using is a rather ugly (yet effective) series of if and else if statements in a for loop that iterates through the string and transforms the characters based on whether they are upper or lower case. Coming up with this solution required me to look on Github and other similar solutions, as well as looking at C++ documentation and learning how characters are represented in the code. I had to learn what it meant to “add” a number to a character to transform it into a different one. Overall, improving the artifact gave me a deeper understanding of the inner workings of the language.

## Algorithm and Data Structures: Vector Sorting Project
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79820705/173485528-772da47a-ebd6-42f5-bb5a-159a060cc530.png)

The artifact I chose for the Data Structures and Algorithm section is a C++ project I worked on for an algorithms course in late 2020. It’s a program that reads from a CSV file filled with ‘bids’ for various ‘auction items’ and loads them into structs and then into a vector. The user is presented with a menu, which allows them to display the list of bids and then sort them using either a selection sort or a quicksort. The program also tracks the time taken to perform each sort for demonstration purposes. 

I chose this artifact because the use of vectors and structs demonstrates a strong understanding of data structures. It also uses two different sorting algorithms, which demonstrates an understanding of algorithm concepts. The quicksort algorithm uses recursion, which is another skill that is therefore exemplified by this project. I improved the artifact by writing two new algorithms: A bubble sort algorithm and an insertion sort algorithm. The code was written in a modular fashion, making these new additions relatively easy to implement. These two new additions further demonstrate experience in writing algorithms to accomplish specific goals. 

After finishing the enhancements, I have met the course outcomes I planned to meet. The four algorithms demonstrate the ability to design computing solutions that solve a given problem (sorting bids) using algorithmic principles. This lines up with course outcome CS-499-03. The variety of algorithms available, which vary in speed and efficiency, demonstrates the ability to manage the trade-off involved in design choices. 

The original code was, somehow, not complete when I began my enhancement. Some of the inclusions in the header did not work as intended. As a result, I ran into challenges getting the program to work initially (as it had been two years since I had worked on it), and it was a little challenging to figure out what the problem was. Creating and improving this project helped me to understand structs a lot more, which was initially a challenging concept to wrap my head around. Figuring out the logic behind various sorting algorithms was also very enlightening, as it required me to think in terms of for loops and while loops, which is a fundamental concept in C++ and programming in general. In developing this artifact, I have gained a much better understanding of loops, structs, data structures, and the deceptively simple logic behind commonplace sorting algorithms.
